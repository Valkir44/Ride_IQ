                the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing company, has dominated the industry since its inception in
                2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued at $51 billion,
                spurring increasing talks of the company filing for an IPO.</p>
            <p>More than 30 Billion Transportation Providers out there and more than 250 Million Passengers every
                day.</p>
            <h3>We have the ONLY<br>
                solution for it!</h3>
            <p class="indentation_p">The idea, one platform that will gives you the expense or readiness based
                choice by quoting typical
                prices from many competing on-demand services for their rides. One app that displays competing
                quotes, organized by cost vs. time of arrival to the originating location.</p>

                            customer an option to open bid for their trip. For example:</p>
                        <p>,,I’m at AIRPORT and need to go to DOWNTOWN ; I select my FROM and TO and enter the price I’m

                        <p>App will show a suggested price based on lowest historical average for that route. Let’s say
                            suggested price is $55, but I’m entering my “wish price” of $35. This gives companies a
                            chance to bid on this offer if they have available cars at the same destination.</p>

                    which are suffering right now,
